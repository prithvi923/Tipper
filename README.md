## Notes

I wanted to learn how to create an iOS app programmatically, rather than with Interface Builder. 
As a result, I removed the Storyboard files and went through the challenge of implementing a working app completely with code.
This included how to implement the entry point into the app; transitioning between view controllers; and positioning views correctly and flexibly.
